# Detection Engineering

The goal of detection engineering is to identify potential security threats before they can cause damage or disruption to an organization's operations.

The key components of detection engineering include:

    Data collection: Collecting and aggregating data from various systems, applications, and services is the first step in detecting security threats. This can include log data, network traffic data, endpoint data, and other relevant data sources.

    Data processing: Once data has been collected, it must be processed and analyzed to identify potential security threats or anomalies. 

    Alerting and response: When a potential security threat or anomaly is detected, an alert should be generated to notify security personnel. The alert should include relevant information, such as the type of threat, the affected systems or applications, and the severity of the threat. 

    Continuous improvement: Detection engineering is an ongoing process, and security controls should be continuously monitored, updated, and improved to ensure that they remain effective over time. This can involve reviewing logs and alerts, analyzing incident data, and refining security controls to better detect and respond to new types of threats or anomalies.
