"Zero Trust" is a holistic model for securing network, application, and data resources, with a focus on providing an identity-centric policy model for controlling access. 
"Zero Trust" shifts security from an ineffective perimeter-centric model to a resource and identity-centric model. 

Zero Trust Principles
--> Core principles
    -- Ensure all resources are accessed securely, regardless of location
    -- Adopt a least privilege strategy and strictly enforce access control
    -- Inspect and log all traffic
--> Expanded principles
    -- Ensure all components support APIs for event and data exchange
    -- Automate actions across environments and systems, driven by context & events
    -- Deliver tactical and strategic value

Gartner 
--> Continuous Adaptive Risk and Trust Assessment (CARTA)
The premise of CARTA is to provide continuous risk assessment as it pertains to,         
        users, 
        devices, 
        applications, 
        data, 
        and workloads, 
from a perspective of 
        Predict, 
        Prevent, 
        Detect, 
        and Respond. 
Gartner tends to view zero trust a bit more narrowly, using the terms
        Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)
for user-to-server security, 
        and Zero Trust Network Segmentation (ZTNS)
for microsegmentation/server-to-server security.
